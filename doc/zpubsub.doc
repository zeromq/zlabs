#### zpubsub - simple pubsub framework

The zpubsub class provides a simple pubsub framework.


zpubsub allows publishing of a "topic", being a message of
a certain type, known to both the publisher of said
message, and its subscribers. Publishers and subscribers
operate on a specific domain (an integer id) which, in the
context of a CZMQ zpubsub instance, translates into a specific
TCP port on which they communicate. Messages are further filtered
on "partition", which is a string passed when publishing a message
or when subscribing to specific message types.

zpubsub borrows some terminology from the Object Management Group
Data Distribution Service (http://www.omg.org/hot-topics/dds.htm),
but is in no way associated with the efforts of the OMG, neither
does it claim to be in any way compliant with the DDS specification.
It is, however, implemented as a simple alternative to using a full
fledge DDS implementation to achieve the purposes intended for the
zpubsub class.

zpubsub relies heavily on the zactor and zloop implementations to
achieve asynchronous behaviour, and uses the zbeacon to broadcast
the presence of publishers. The basic mechanisms for publishing
and subscribing are of course implemented by way of 0MQ PUB and
SUB sockets.

The message serialization protocol is fully up to the application.
zpubsub accepts a blob of data for publishing and delivers the
same blob unchanged to the subscribers. Filter data is serialized
through a zproto-generated codec.

Two examples are included in the examples/zpubsub directory.
The simple example is implemented in pure C, with the simplest
form of (platform-dependent) binary serialization. The protobuf
example wraps zpubsub in a Participant class, which uses
Google Protocol Buffers to serialize data in a portable manner.

This is the class interface:

    //  Function to calculate port from domain id
    typedef dbyte (zpubsub_port_fn) (int domain);
    
    //  Subscribers get a callback when a sample is available
    typedef void (zpubsub_sample_fn) (const char *topic, const char *partition,
                                      void *args, byte *sample, size_t size);
    
    //  Create a new pubsub, passing functions to use for serializing and
    //  deserializing filters.
    ZLABS_EXPORT zpubsub_t *
        zpubsub_new (int domain, const char* partition);
    
    //  Publish a message on a given topic.
    ZLABS_EXPORT void
        zpubsub_publish (zpubsub_t *self, const char *topic, const char *partition,
                         byte *message, size_t size);
    
    //  Subscribe to messages on a given topic.
    ZLABS_EXPORT void
        zpubsub_subscribe (zpubsub_t *self,
                           const char *topic, const char *partition,
                           void *args, zpubsub_sample_fn *sample_fn);
    
    //  Unsubscribe from messages on a given topic.
    ZLABS_EXPORT void
        zpubsub_unsubscribe (zpubsub_t *self,
                             const char *topic, const char *partition);
    
    //  Destroy a pubsub instance.
    ZLABS_EXPORT void
        zpubsub_destroy (zpubsub_t **p_self);
    
    //  Probe the supplied object, and report if it looks like a zpubsub_t.
    ZLABS_EXPORT bool
    	zpubsub_is (void *self);
    
    //  Self test of this class
    ZLABS_EXPORT void
        zpubsub_test (bool verbose);

This is the class self test code:

    //  Create pubsub instance
    zpubsub_t * pubsub = zpubsub_new (25, NULL);
    assert (pubsub);
    s_test_msg_recvd = false;
    
    //  Subscribe to test topic
    zpubsub_subscribe (pubsub, "TestTopic", NULL, NULL, s_sample_fn);
    
    //  Sleep for 6 seconds; should have received a publisher
    //  beacon by then and connected
    zclock_sleep (6000);
    
    //  Create a test message
    test_msg_t *tmsg = (test_msg_t *) zmalloc (sizeof (test_msg_t));
    assert (tmsg);
    tmsg->hello = strdup ("Hello");
    tmsg->world = 30116;
    
    //  Serialize message
    size_t sample_size;
    byte *sample = s_serialize_message (tmsg, &sample_size);
    
    //  Publish on the test topic
    zpubsub_publish (pubsub, "TestTopic", NULL, sample, sample_size);
    zclock_sleep (1000); //  Sleeping one second after publish to make sure
                         //  subscriber processing is finished
    
    //  Should have received the message now
    assert (s_test_msg_recvd);
    s_test_msg_recvd = false;
    
    //  Publish on different partition
    zpubsub_publish (pubsub, "TestTopic", "TestPartition", sample, sample_size);
    zclock_sleep (1000);
    
    //  Should not receive this message
    assert (!s_test_msg_recvd);
    s_test_msg_recvd = false;
    
    //  Publish on another topic
    zpubsub_publish (pubsub, "TestTopic2", NULL, sample, sample_size);
    zclock_sleep (1000);
    
    //  Should not receive this message
    assert (!s_test_msg_recvd);
    s_test_msg_recvd = false;
    
    //  Publish on the test topic again
    zpubsub_publish (pubsub, "TestTopic", NULL, sample, sample_size);
    zclock_sleep (1000);
    
    //  Should receive this message
    assert (s_test_msg_recvd);
    s_test_msg_recvd = false;
    
    //  Unsubscribe and publish again
    zpubsub_unsubscribe (pubsub, "TestTopic", NULL);
    zpubsub_publish (pubsub, "TestTopic", NULL, sample, sample_size);
    zclock_sleep (1000);
    
    //  Should not receive this message
    assert (!s_test_msg_recvd);
    
    //  Destroy pubsub instance
    zpubsub_destroy (&pubsub);
    assert (pubsub == NULL);
    
    free (tmsg->hello);
    free (tmsg);
    free (sample);
